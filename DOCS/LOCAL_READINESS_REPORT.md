# Local Readiness Report — User Management Service

_This report predates the PostgreSQL → SQLite migration and is kept as a historical record of that verification pass (Postgres/WSL setup details below no longer apply — the backend now persists to a local SQLite file, see `DOCS/RUN_APPLICATION.md`)._

**Verdict: (A) Backend is fully running and ready for frontend integration.**

All 4 features (F-01 Registration, F-02 OTP, F-03 Login, F-04 Account Deletion) are implemented, wired, and verified end-to-end against a live Postgres + Redis instance. One real bug was found and fixed during verification (account-deletion confirmation was unconditionally returning 500). CORS was added since none existed and it would have hard-blocked frontend integration.

## Repository Analysis

TypeScript/Express service, raw `pg` (no ORM), `ioredis`, SendGrid email, bcrypt, hand-rolled constructor-injection DI (no container), no Docker/Docker Compose, no pre-existing Swagger. Full detail: `docs/PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md`.

## Detected Technologies

Node 20.x · TypeScript 5.5.4 (strict) · Express 4.19.2 · PostgreSQL (via `pg` 8.12.0) · Redis (via `ioredis`) · SendGrid · bcrypt · Jest/ts-jest/Supertest/fast-check · npm. Full table: `docs/PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md`.

## Implemented Features

All 4 features fully implemented and matching their `.kiro` design docs — no Missing/Broken/Not-Wired items found. One self-documented deviation: OTP delivers via email, not SMS (intentional, noted in code). Full validation: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`.

## Startup Commands

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm start          # or: node dist/server.js
```
Full detail incl. startup order and shutdown sequence: `docs/RUN_APPLICATION.md`.

## Migration Commands

```powershell
npm run db:migrate   # NOT idempotent — fails if tables already exist (no tracking table)
```
All 8 expected tables already existed and were verified present in `ums_db` — no migration needed to run in this session. Manual rollback/reset procedure documented in `docs/RUN_APPLICATION.md`.

## Environment Variables

`.env` / `.env.example` fully cross-checked against every `requireEnvString`/`process.env` read in `src/config/*.ts` — no missing variables found. One variable added this session: `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` (optional, for CORS). Full reference: `.env.example`.

## API Status

All 12 originally-specified routes + 1 extra spec-driven admin route are mounted and live-verified (curl-tested, none 404). Full contract per endpoint: `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`.

| Route | Verified |
|---|---|
| POST /api/v1/users/register | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/users/activate | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/otp/send | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/otp/resend | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/auth/login | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/auth/logout | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/auth/password-recovery | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset | ✅ |
| GET /health | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/users/deletion-requests | ✅ |
| DELETE /api/v1/users/deletion-requests | ✅ |
| POST /api/v1/users/deletion-requests/confirm | ✅ (fixed — was 500) |
| POST /api/v1/admin/users/:user_id/resend-confirmation | ✅ (extra, spec-driven) |

## Worker Status

`OutboxWorker` (F-01) and `AccountDeletionNotificationWorker` (F-04) both start automatically on boot (30s poll interval), confirmed via server logs. Both attempt real SendGrid dispatch and correctly log `[SendGridEmailAdapter] Delivery failed` with placeholder API keys — expected behavior, not a bug.

## Swagger Status

**Added this session** — no Swagger existed before. `docs/openapi.yaml` generated from the actual routes/controllers; live Swagger UI mounted at `GET /api-docs` (verified `200`).

## Database Status

✅ Reachable and verified. Runs inside **WSL Ubuntu** (Postgres 16), not natively on Windows. A native Windows PostgreSQL 17 service was found squatting on port 5432, shadowing WSL's localhost-forwarding — worked around by pointing `.env`'s `PGHOST` at the WSL VM IP directly (dynamic; see `docs/RUN_APPLICATION.md` for the permanent fix and refresh procedure). All 8 expected tables confirmed present.

## Redis Status

✅ Reachable via `localhost:6379` — no conflict here (WSL's `wslrelay` correctly forwards this port, unlike Postgres). Confirmed with `PONG`.

## Postman Status

**Added this session** — `postman/UMS.postman_collection.json` (all endpoints, ordered to match the E2E flow, auto-chains `userId`/`jwt` via test scripts) + `postman/UMS.postman_environment.json`. Email-delivered tokens (activation/recovery/deletion) require manual entry per-request (documented inline) since this environment's SendGrid key is a placeholder.

## Frontend Readiness

**CORS added this session** (none existed — would have hard-blocked every browser frontend). Full guide with field-naming/error-casing inconsistencies and integration gotchas: `docs/FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`.

## Known Issues

1. **Fixed**: `confirmDeletion` SQL bug (parameter `$2` reused across incompatible SQL type contexts) caused every account-deletion confirmation to return `500`. Fixed in `src/services/account-deletion.service.ts`; test mock updated in `src/services/account-deletion.service.property.test.ts` to match.
2. **Fixed**: `npm run test:integration` intermittently failed (11/36) due to concurrent Jest workers racing table-truncation across spec files sharing one live DB. Fixed by adding `--runInBand` to the script in `package.json`.
3. **Fixed**: No CORS middleware existed. Added (`cors` package, reflects request origin by default, configurable via `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`).
4. **Environment-specific, not a code defect**: native Windows Postgres service conflicts with WSL's on port 5432. Worked around via WSL VM IP; permanent fix requires stopping the Windows service with admin rights (documented, not auto-applied — needs your explicit action).
5. **Not fixed (flagged only, out of this session's scope)**: no OTP-verification endpoint exists — `/otp/send`/`/otp/resend` only confirm dispatch. If any frontend flow needs to check a user-submitted OTP code, a new backend endpoint is required first.
6. **Not fixed (flagged only)**: no global HTTP rate limiting on registration/activation/password-recovery/deletion-request routes; no request/access logging; inconsistent camelCase/snake_case field naming and `errorCode`/`error_code` casing across features. None block integration, but all are worth a follow-up pass.

## Future Improvements

- Add a migration-tracking table (e.g. adopt `node-pg-migrate` or a simple `schema_migrations` table) so `db:migrate` is idempotent and supports real rollback.
- Add request/access logging (e.g. `pino-http`) and a centralized `AppError` base class to collapse the ~17 manual `instanceof` branches in `src/app.ts`'s error handler.
- Normalize field-naming and error-code casing across features (breaking change — coordinate with any frontend already integrated).
- Decide whether OTP needs a verification endpoint, and if so, design and implement it.
- Set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` and consider `helmet` before any production-like deployment.
- Resolve the Windows/WSL Postgres port conflict permanently (stop/disable the native Windows service) rather than relying on the WSL VM IP workaround.

## Final verification performed

- `npm run build` — clean, no errors
- `npm run test:unit` — 139/139 passing
- `npm run test:integration` (serial) — 36/36 passing
